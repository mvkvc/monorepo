# Running Phi-3 with Tenstorrent Buda - part 1

After seeing the `tt-buda-demos` [repo](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-buda-demos) issues I saw that there is a bountry for Phi-2, however Phi-3 came out with a mini variant which seems like a more promising target. You can see the full code on my [fork](https://github.com/mvkvc/tt-buda-demos/tree/add_phi3).
