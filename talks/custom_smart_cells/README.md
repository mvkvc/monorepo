# custom_smart_cells

Materials for a talk given by [@mvkvc](https://github.com/mvkvc) and [@einariii](https://github.com/einariii) for the Toronto Elixir meetup exploring creating your own custom Elixir Livebook smart cells.

For this talk we created three new smart cells:

- [`kino_util`](../../libs/ex/kino_util/README.md)
- [`kino_fly`](../../libs/ex/kino_fly/README.md)
- [`kino_sound`](https://github.com/einariii/kino_sound)
