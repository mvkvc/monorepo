# research

- Model incentives before coding contracts
- Some distribution of users
  - Can be power law w/ some whales
  - Distribution of beliefs about a case
  - Distribution of intent to deceive
  - Collusion number
- First steps
  - Outline all components clearly
- Model
  - N agent simulation
  - Variable M cases per day
  - Case selection
    - Users go where they have a max chance to be selected
    - Can work on multiple at once (maybe leave this)
      - Idea to lock from more than one in FE
      - Bad probably if time locked for voting over X days
  - Each case has some belief distribution
    - Likely skewed as majority of cases are pretty clear
  - We want to model few specific scenarios
    - All honest actors
      - Does the system reward honest abitrators?
      - Rational defection from true beliefs
      - As you build reputation there is an incentive to use your repuutation stake influence to defect for a payoff
      - Your reputation as stake to recieve the rewards is a value generating asset if you partiicipate in the system
      - Map the value of your reputation as a cash flowing asset and the balance between defection to recieve immediate reward and the loss of your reputation as a cash flowing asset
      - QQQ
